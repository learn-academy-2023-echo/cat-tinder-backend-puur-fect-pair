As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application where a user can see cute cats looking for friends. As a user, I can see a list of cats. I can click on a cat and see more information about that cat. I can also add cats to the list of cats looking for friends. If my work is acceptable to my client, I may also be asked to add the ability to remove a cat from the list as well as edit cat information.
